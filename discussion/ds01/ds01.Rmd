```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# We will usually provide a chunk like this for you.
# This is setting "global chunk options"; "global" meaning applying to every chunk in the rest of the document.
#   echo = TRUE causes every chunk to appear in the knitted file.
#   warning = FALSE causes warning messages (different than errors) to NOT appear in the knitted file.
#   message = FALSE causes other messages (like those from loading packages) to NOT appear in the knitted file.

# Notice include = FALSE as a chunk option at the top of this chunk in line 6. This means that neither this chunk nor its output will appear in the knitted file.

# Submission

When you have answered the above questions, please knit this file and submit **BOTH** the R Markdown file (.Rmd) and the knitted html file (.html).

We will ask for both files for every assignment in this course.

We will grade directly from the .html file, so make sure you are satisfied with how it looks before you submit. We ask for your .Rmd as a backup in case your .html file has errors in it.
